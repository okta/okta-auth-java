The Okta Authentication SDK is a convenience wrapper around [Okta's Authentication API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/authn.html).

**NOTE:** Using OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect to integrate your application instead of this library will require much less work, and has a smaller risk profile. Please see [this guide](https://developer.okta.com/use_cases/authentication/) to see if using this API is right for your use case. You could also use our [Spring Boot Integration](https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot), or [Spring Security](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/12/18/spring-security-5-oidc) out of the box.

Okta's Authentication API is built around a [state machine](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/authn#transaction-state). In order to use this library you will need to be familiar with the available states. You will need to implement a handler for each state you want to support.

We also publish these libraries for Java:
 
* [Spring Boot Integration](https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot/)
* [Okta JWT Verifier for Java](https://github.com/okta/okta-jwt-verifier-java)
* [Management SDK](https://github.com/okta/okta-sdk-java)
 
You can learn more on the [Okta + Java][lang-landing] page in our documentation.

* Ask questions on the [Okta Developer Forums][devforum]
* Post [issues][github-issues] here on GitHub (for code errors)
 
## Getting started
 
To use this SDK you will need to include the following dependencies:

For Apache Maven:

``` xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.okta.sdk</groupId>
    <artifactId>okta-authn-sdk-api</artifactId>
    <version>${okta.authn.version}</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.okta.sdk</groupId>
    <artifactId>okta-authn-sdk-impl</artifactId>
    <version>${okta.authn.version}</version>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.okta.sdk</groupId>
    <artifactId>okta-sdk-httpclient</artifactId>
    <version>${okta.sdk.version}</version>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
```

For Gradle:

```groovy
compile 'com.okta.sdk:okta-authn-sdk-api:${okta.version}'
runtime 'com.okta.sdk:okta-authn-sdk-impl:${okta.version}'
runtime 'com.okta.sdk:okta-sdk-httpclient:${okta.version}'
```

### SNAPSHOT Dependencies

Snapshots are deployed off of the 'master' branch to [OSSRH](https://oss.sonatype.org/) and can be consumed using the following repository configured for Apache Maven or Gradle:

```txt
https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/
```

You'll also need:

* An Okta account, called an _organization_ (sign up for a free [developer organization](https://developer.okta.com/signup) if you need one)

 
Construct a client instance by passing it your Okta domain name and API token:
 
[//]: # (NOTE: code snippets in this README are updated automatically via a Maven plugin by running: mvn okta-code-snippet:snip.okta:okta-code-snippet-maven-plugin:snip)
 
[//]: # (method: createClient)
```java
AuthenticationClient client = AuthenticationClients.builder()
    .setOrgUrl("https://{yourOktaDomain}")
    .build();
```
[//]: # (end: createClient)
 
Hard-coding the Okta domain works for quick tests, but for real projects you should use a more secure way of storing these values (such as environment variables). This library supports a few different configuration sources, covered in the [configuration reference](#configuration-reference) section.
 
## Usage guide

These examples will help you understand how to use this library. You can also browse the full [API reference documentation][javadocs].

Once you initialize a `AuthenticationClient`, you can call methods to make requests to the Okta Authentication API. To call other Okta APIs, see the [Management SDK](https://github.com/okta/okta-sdk-java).

### Authenticate a User

An authentication flow usually starts with a call to `authenticate`:

```java
// could be where to redirect when authentication is done, a token, or null
String relayState = "/application/specific";
client.authenticate(username, password, relayState, stateHandler);
```

Everything looks pretty standard except for `stateHandler`.  The [`AuthenticationStateHandler`](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-java/blob/master/api/src/main/java/com/okta/authn/sdk/AuthenticationStateHandler.java) is a mechanism to fire an event for the given authentication state returned.  Basically, it prevents you from needing to use something like a switch statement to check state of the `AuthenticationResponse`.

A typical `AuthenticationStateHandler` may look something like:

```java
public class ExampleAuthenticationStateHandler extends AuthenticationStateHandlerAdapter {

    @Override
    public void handleUnknown(AuthenticationResponse unknownResponse) {
        // redirect to "/error"
    }

    @Override
    public void handleSuccess(AuthenticationResponse successResponse) {
        
        // a user is ONLY considered authenticated if a sessionToken exists
        if (Strings.hasLength(successResponse.getSessionToken())) {
            String relayState = successResponse.getRelayState();
            String dest = relayState != null ? relayState : "/";
            // redirect to dest    
        }
        // other state transition successful 
    }

    @Override
    public void handlePasswordExpired(AuthenticationResponse passwordExpired) {
        // redirect to "/login/change-password"
    }
    
    // Other implemented states here
}
```

As noted in the above example, a user is ONLY considered authenticated if `AuthenticationResponse.getSessionToken()` is not null. This `sessionToken` can be exchanged via the [Okta Sessions API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/authn.html#session-token) to start an SSO session, but that is beyond the scope of this library.

**NOTE:** `UNKNOWN` is not an actual state in Okta's state model. The method handleUnknown is called when an unimplemented or unrecognized state is reached. This could happen if:

- Your handler doesn't have an implementation for the state that was just returned
- Your Okta organization configuration changed, and a new state is now possible (for example, an admin turned on multi-factor authentication)
- Okta added something new to the state model entirely


## Configuration reference
  
This library looks for configuration in the following sources:

0. An `okta.yaml` at the root of the applications classpath
0. An `okta.yaml` file in a `.okta` folder in the current user's home directory (`~/.okta/okta.yaml` or `%userprofile\.okta\okta.yaml`)
0. Environment variables
0. Java System Properties
0. Configuration explicitly passed to the constructor (see the example in [Getting started](#getting-started))
 
Higher numbers win. In other words, configuration passed via the constructor will override configuration found in environment variables, which will override configuration in `okta.yaml` (if any), and so on.
 
### YAML configuration
 
The full YAML configuration looks like:
 
```yaml
okta:
  client:
    connectionTimeout: 30 # seconds
    orgUrl: "https://{yourOktaDomain}" # i.e. https://dev-123456.oktapreview.com
    proxy:
      port: null
      host: null
      username: null
      password: null
    requestTimeout: 10 # seconds
    rateLimit:
      maxRetries: 2
```
 
### Environment variables
 
Each one of the configuration values above can be turned into an environment variable name with the `_` (underscore) character:
 
* `OKTA_CLIENT_CONNECTIONTIMEOUT`
* `OKTA_CLIENT_RATELIMIT_MAXRETRIES`
* and so on

### System properties

Each one of of the configuration values written in 'dot' notation to be used as a Java system property:
* `okta.client.connectionTimeout`
* `okta.client.rateLimt.maxRetries`
* and so on

## Connection Retry / Rate Limiting

By default this SDK will retry requests that are return with a `503`, `504`, `429`, or socket/connection exceptions.  To disable this functionality set the properties `okta.client.requestTimeout` and `okta.client.rateLimit.maxRetries` to `0`.

Setting only one of the values to zero will disable that check. Meaning, by default, four retry attempts will be made. If you set `okta.client.requestTimeout` to `45` seconds and `okta.client.rateLimit.maxRetries` to `0`. This SDK will continue to retry indefinitely for `45` seconds.  If both values are non zero, this SDK will attempt to retry until either of the conditions are met (not both).

## Building the SDK
 
In most cases, you won't need to build the SDK from source. If you want to build it yourself, take a look at the [build instructions wiki](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-java/wiki/Build-It) (though just cloning the repo and running `mvn install` should get you going).
